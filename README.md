# fucking-zsh
ZSH configurations on Mac

Usage:

- Clone the repository into a reasonable location (e.g. $HOME/Development/org.nerdsofprey/fucking-zsh)
- Remove (or merge) your current .zshrc, replacing it with the line ```source $HOME/Development/org.nerdsofprey/fucking-zsh/.zshrc"```
- now it's the same everywhere, great job
